# Brain Tumour Detection

This project aims to detect brain tumors in MRI images using deep learning techniques. It is implemented in Python using the Google Colab environment. Transfer learning is employed to leverage pre-trained models and achieve higher prediction accuracy. Several functions are implemented to address the challenge of overfitting and improve the overall performance of the model. Additionally, the Gradio library is utilized to provide a user-friendly frontend display, allowing users to conveniently drag and drop images for classification.

## Project Overview

The "Brain Tumour Detection" project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify MRI images as either containing a brain tumor or being tumor-free. The following key components and techniques are employed:

1. **Google Colab Environment:** The project is developed using the Google Colab platform, which provides a powerful and convenient environment for executing Python code, including deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow.

2. **Transfer Learning:** Transfer learning is utilized to leverage the knowledge of pre-trained models, such as VGG16 or ResNet, to enhance the prediction accuracy of the brain tumor detection model. By utilizing a pre-trained model as a feature extractor, the project reduces the need for extensive training on a large dataset.

3. **Overfitting Reduction:** To combat overfitting, various techniques are implemented. These include data augmentation, dropout layers, and regularization techniques like L1 and L2 regularization. These measures help improve the generalization ability of the model and prevent it from memorizing the training data.

4. **Gradio Library for Frontend Display:** The Gradio library is integrated into the project to create an intuitive frontend interface. Users can conveniently drag and drop MRI images into the provided section for classification. The output of the model, indicating whether a brain tumor is present or not, is displayed in real-time, providing a seamless user experience.

5. **Accurate Predictions:** The model is trained using a diverse set of MRI images, including data obtained from Google searches. By training on a comprehensive dataset, the model achieves accurate predictions not only on the testing set but also on real-world images.

## Getting Started

To run the "Brain Tumour Detection" project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `brain_tumour_detection.ipynb` in Google Colab or any compatible environment. Ensure that the required dependencies are installed.

3. Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially to perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

4. Drag and drop MRI images into the frontend interface to classify them as tumor or tumor-free cases. Observe the real-time predictions provided by the model.
